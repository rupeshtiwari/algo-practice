Sure, let's walk through the corrected code line by line for the example `[3, 2, 4]` with the target `6` to understand how it works.

Here's the corrected code again:

```javascript
var twoSum = function (nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    let complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  
  return [];
};

console.log(twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6));  // Output: [1, 2]
```

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Initialization:**
   ```javascript
   const map = new Map();
   ```
   - We create a new empty map called `map`. This map will store numbers from the array as keys and their indices as values.

2. **First Iteration (i = 0):**
   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
     let complement = target - nums[i];
     if (map.has(complement)) {
       return [map.get(complement), i];
     }
     map.set(nums[i], i);
   }
   ```
   - `i = 0`, `nums[i] = 3`
   - We calculate the complement: `complement = 6 - 3 = 3`
   - We check if the complement (`3`) is in the map: `map.has(3)` returns `false` because the map is currently empty.
   - We add the current number and its index to the map: `map.set(3, 0)`
   - The map now looks like this: `{ 3: 0 }`

3. **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
   - `i = 1`, `nums[i] = 2`
   - We calculate the complement: `complement = 6 - 2 = 4`
   - We check if the complement (`4`) is in the map: `map.has(4)` returns `false`.
   - We add the current number and its index to the map: `map.set(2, 1)`
   - The map now looks like this: `{ 3: 0, 2: 1 }`

4. **Third Iteration (i = 2):**
   - `i = 2`, `nums[i] = 4`
   - We calculate the complement: `complement = 6 - 4 = 2`
   - We check if the complement (`2`) is in the map: `map.has(2)` returns `true` because `2` is a key in the map with the value `1` (its index).
   - Since the complement is found in the map, we return the indices: `[map.get(2), i]` which translates to `[1, 2]`

So, the function returns `[1, 2]`, which are the indices of the numbers `2` and `4` in the array `[3, 2, 4]` that add up to the target `6`.

### Explanation of Map Usage

- The map is used to keep track of the indices of the numbers we've seen so far.
- For each number in the array, we calculate what the other number (`complement`) needs to be in order to sum to the target.
- We then check if this `complement` has been seen before (i.e., is in the map).
- If it is, we return the indices of the current number and the `complement`.
- If it is not, we add the current number and its index to the map and continue.

This approach ensures that we find the two indices in a single pass through the array, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n).
