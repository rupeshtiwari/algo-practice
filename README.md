# Algorithm Practice with Node.js

This repository contains solutions to common algorithm problems implemented in Node.js, along with unit tests to verify their correctness. Jest is used as the testing framework.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/algo-practice.git
   cd algo-practice
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Project Structure

└── README.md            # Project overview and setup instructions
```

### Running Tests

To execute the unit tests, run:
```bash
npm test
```

### Adding New Algorithms

1. Create a new JavaScript file in the `src` directory:
   ```bash
   touch src/newAlgorithm.js
   ```
2. Implement your algorithm in the new file.
3. Create a corresponding test file in the `tests` directory:
   ```bash
   touch tests/newAlgorithm.test.js
   ```
4. Write test cases for your algorithm in the test file.
